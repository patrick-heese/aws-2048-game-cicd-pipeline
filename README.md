# 2048 Game CI/CD Pipeline  
Automated build/test/deploy to ECS Fargate; signals: zero-secrets OIDC, gated deploys via CodePipeline/CodeBuild.  

A cloud-native project that demonstrates how to implement a **continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline** on AWS. The application is the classic **2048 Game**, containerized with Docker and deployed on **Amazon ECS** using **AWS Fargate**.  

This pipeline automatically builds and deploys updates whenever code is pushed to GitHub. The infrastructure leverages **Terraform** for reproducibility and Infrastructure as Code best practices. The application runs in the **default VPC and subnets**, making the setup straightforward without custom networking.

## Architecture Overview

*Figure 1: Architecture diagram of the 2048 Game CI/CD Pipeline.*  

### Core Components
- **Amazon ECR** – Stores Docker images for the 2048 application.  
- **Amazon ECS (Fargate)** – Runs the containerized application serverlessly.  
- **AWS CodePipeline** – Orchestrates the end-to-end CI/CD workflow.  
- **AWS CodeBuild** – Builds Docker images, tags them, and pushes them to ECR.  
- **AWS CodeDeploy** – Updates ECS services with new container images.  
- **Amazon S3** – Stores pipeline artifacts such as `imagedefinitions.json`.  
- **AWS CloudWatch Logs** – Captures application and build logs for monitoring.  
- **AWS IAM** – Manages least-privilege roles and policies for ECS, CodeBuild, and CodePipeline.  

## Skills Applied  
- Automating a **GitHub-triggered CI/CD pipeline** with AWS CodePipeline.  
- Containerizing the **2048 game application** using Docker.  
- Deploying workloads on **Amazon ECS with Fargate** to eliminate server management.  
- Managing container images with a private **Amazon ECR repository**.  
- Scoping IAM roles and policies to enforce **least-privilege access** for pipeline, ECS tasks, and builds.  
- Enabling **CloudWatch Logs** for centralized monitoring of ECS tasks and CodeBuild.  

## Features  
- **Fully automated pipeline** – From GitHub commit → Build → Deploy to ECS.  
- **Serverless containers** – Application runs on **ECS Fargate** with no EC2 management.  
- **Immutable builds** – Each Git push generates a new Docker image in ECR.  
- **Scalable architecture** – ECS service can be scaled by adjusting desired task count.  
- **Cross-service integration** – Seamless orchestration across ECR, ECS, S3, CodeBuild, and CodePipeline.  

## Tech Stack  
- **Languages:** Dockerfile  
- **AWS Services:** CodePipeline, CodeBuild, CodeDeploy, ECS (Fargate), ECR, S3, IAM, CloudWatch  
- **IaC Tool:** Terraform  
- **Other Tools:** GitHub, Docker, AWS CLI  

## Deployment Instructions  
> **Note:** Many commands are identical across shells; the main differences are line continuation (PowerShell: `` ` `` • Bash: `\` • cmd.exe: `^`), environment variables (PowerShell: `$env:NAME=...` • Bash: `NAME=...` • cmd.exe: `set NAME=...`), and path separators.  

1. Clone this repository.  

2. Create a new repository in GitHub and push `2048-game` folder to it using Git:  
    ```bash
    cd 2048-game
    git init
    git add .
    git commit -m "Initial commit"
    git remote add origin git@github.com:<your-username>/<repository-name>.git
    git branch -M main
    git push -u origin main
   ```

3. In AWS Developer Tools > Connections, create a CodeConnection to GitHub and authorize the repository.  

4. Create the IAM Role for ECS `AWSServiceRoleForECS` if it does not exist.  

- **Windows (PowerShell):**  
    ```powershell
    try {
      aws iam create-service-linked-role --aws-service-name ecs.amazonaws.com
      }
    catch {
      Write-Host "Service-linked role already exists, continuing..."
      }
    ```

- **Linux:**  
    ```bash
    aws iam create-service-linked-role --aws-service-name ecs.amazonaws.com || true
    ```

### Terraform
5. Edit variables in `terraform.tfvars` and/or `variables.tf` to customize the deployment.  

6. Navigate to the `terraform` folder and deploy:  
   ```bash
   cd terraform
   terraform init
   terraform plan # Optional, but recommended.
   terraform apply
   ```  
   
7. *(Optional)* Edit the files in the `2048-game` directory and push them using Git. The CodePipeline will automatically deploy a new ECS task.  
 
> **Note**: Ensure the AWS CLI user (`aws configure`) or Terraform assumed role has sufficient permissions to manage **S3**, **ECS/ECR resources**, **CodeBuild/CodeDeploy/CodePipeline resources**, **CloudWatch Logs**, **Security Groups**, and **IAM resources**.  

## How to Use  
1. **Deploy the infrastructure** using Terraform.  

2. **Access the application** in a web browser via the ECS Task Public IP address:  
    ```plaintext
    http://<ECS Task Public IP Address>
    ```

3. Use the **arrow keys** to move the tiles. Tiles with the same number merge into one when they touch. Add them up to reach 2048.

- **Custom VPC & Networking**: Use private subnets, NAT gateway, and ALB for production-grade architecture.  
- **Scaling Policies** : Enable **ECS Service Auto Scaling** via CloudWatch alarms.  
- **Monitoring Dashboard**: Add **CloudWatch Dashboards** and **Alarms** for observability.  
- **HTTPS Support**: Integrate **Application Load Balancer + ACM SSL certificate** for secure access.

## Acknowledgments  
This project was inspired by a course from [techwithlucy](https://github.com/techwithlucy).  
The 2048 game application code is taken directly from the author’s original implementation. The `buildspec.yml` file was edited to include variables for portability.  
The architecture diagram included here is my own version, adapted from the original course diagram.  
I designed and developed all Infrastructure as Code (Terraform) and project documentation.
